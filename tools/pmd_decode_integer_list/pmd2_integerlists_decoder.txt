Pass a file containing all the encoded integer lists one after the other. Drag-and-drop onto batch file to output to decoded.txt file!
Program ignores padding bytes at the end.

Supports from 8 bits integers to 32 bits integers ( actually possible integers are 7, 14, 21, 28 bits long, given 1 bit is given up for each byte to encode )

Encoded integers are stored as a sequence of bytes. For each bytes apply those conditional operations.

* If the highest bit of a byte is 1, ignore that bit, bitwise OR that value into the buffer, shift by 7 bits left.
* If the highest bit of a byte is 0, ignore that bit, bitwise OR that into the buffer. No further bytes needs to be appended.
* If the byte is 0, and no previous byte had its highest bit set to 1, its the end of the list!

Ex:
0x81 0x82 0x0 0x08

Buff = ( Buff | (0x81 & 0x7F) ) << 7
Buff = ( Buff | (0x82 & 0x7F) ) << 7 
Buff = ( Buff | (0x0  & 0x7F) ) << 7 
Buff = ( Buff | 0x08 )                  //Since last byte's highest bit was 0, no need to shift left by 7!
return Buff;

Ex2:
0xC1 0x05

Buff = ( Buff | (0xC1 & 0x7F) ) << 7
Buff = ( Buff | 0x05 )                  //Since last byte's highest bit was 0, no need to shift left by 7!
return Buff;

Ex3:
0x01

Buff = ( Buff | 0x01 )
return Buff;

Ex4:
0x00

//Do nothing, end of sequence detected!
