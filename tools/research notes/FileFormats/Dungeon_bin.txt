* Files   0 to 169 seems to be **weird palette files**. (See below)
* Files 170 to 339 are SIR0-wrapped AT4PX compressed images.
* Files 340 to 679 are AT4PX compressed images.
* Files 680 to 849 are raw RGBX32 color palettes.
* Files 850 to 878 seems to be **weird palette files**, again. (See below)
* Files 879 to 936 are AT4PX compressed images.
* Files 937 to 965 are SIR0 wrapped PKDPX files.
* Files 966 to 994 are raw RGBX32 color palettes.
* File  995 is a raw image... possibly 4 bpp
* File  996 is some strange, SIR0 contained headerless data file..
* File  997 is a raw RGBX32 color palettes.
* File  998 is big headerless file with mainly zeros in it..
* File  999 is a raw RGBX32 color palettes.
* File 1000 is a SIR0 wrapped **weird data file**(see format below).
* File 1001 is a WTE file!
* File 1002 is a WTU file!
* File 1003 is a WTE file!
* File 1004 is a WTU file!
* File 1005 is a WTE file!
* File 1006 is a WTU file!
* Files 1007 to 1012 are WTE files!
* File 1013 is WTU file.
* Files 1014 to 1021 are WTE + WTU combos
* File 1022 is some kind of image file. It looks like a format I've seen before! No magic number, but has a header with a pointer to a bunch of sub-sections!
* File 1023 is a SIR0 wrapped file containing 2048 times the value 0xFF000000 !
* Files 1024 and 1025 are WTE files.
* Files 1026 and 1027 are BGP compressed images.
* File 1028 is a WAN sprite!
* File 1029 is a headerless file, with a lot of repeating values, and possibly image data near the end.
* File 1030 contains a raw RGBX32 color palette.
* File 1031 is a WTE file.
* File 1032 is a WTU file.
* File 1033 familiar format SIR0 wrapped, could contain image. not sure.
* File 1034 SIR0 wrapped image data ? Possibly raw RGBA pixels ?
* File 1035 SIR0 wrapped file.. Has a short header, made of 2 pointers. Has a pointer table at the end, and what seems to be a color palette ?
