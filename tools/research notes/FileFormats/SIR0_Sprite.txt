[]  : This indicates a data structure model, like an array or a struct. Basically a bunch of variables 
      together. If there nothing in between, content is either unknown or obvious, or described later 
      on in detail.
       
... : This means that there is a gap filled with data between the element above and below this symbol. 
      When used inside square brackets, it implies that elements based on the model of the element
      above the symbol are repeated for the length of the data structure containing it. Or, if there 
      is an element after this symbol, repeated until the element below the symbol!

*MetaFrames
----------------
Meta-frames only tell the game what should be displayed when they're being referred to.
If the index correspond to an actual image index, that image will be displayed, following the properties
contained in the meta-frame. 

When the index is set to 0xFFFF (or 65,535 / -1 in decimal), this meta-frame will not trigger image loading,
and the game will instead use whatever data is at the sprite's reserved memory spot at the time and 
apply the meta-frame's properties on it. (usually copies the last valid image in the frame group)

When a meta frame is part of a group with more than a single meta frame, and the first meta-frame in the
group has an actual image index as value, and the other meta-frames have 0xFFFF as their index value, 
then all the other meta-frames in the group will be a copy of the first one. Its possible to repeat 
an image multiple times that way for a specific frame, and use the offsets to position all copies.

NOTE: Apparently that meta-frames are assembled in reverse, from the last image strip to the first. As some are 
overlayed over some parts of the pokemon!

(Bit order is from right to left, from the lowest to the highest here!)

**YOffset flags** : bitflags used to tell the game how to read and display the frame. 6 bits are reserved for that purpose.
    bits:
    #14-15 (1100 0000 0000 0000) : "OBJ Shape" modifies the frame's resolution. (see below)

    #9 (0000 0010 0000 0000) : "OBJ Disable" if bit 8 not set, "Double-Size Flag" if bit 8 set.
        - If bit 8 set:
            0 = Normal size 
            1 = Double size "Sprite bounds is doubled (isRotoscale set)"
        - If bit 8 unset:
            0 = Object displayed
            1 = Object hidden
    #8 (0000 0001 0000 0000) : "Rotation/Scaling Flag" (determines what bit 9 does)
        0 = Off

    #0-7 (0000 0000 1111 1111) : Y Offset 
        0 to 255
    

**XOffset flags** : bitflags used to tell the game how to read and display the frame. 7 bits are reserved for that purpose.
The way this value is interpreted changes drastically if the "Rotation/Scaling Flag" was set!

WITH "Rotation/Scaling" FLAG OFF:
    bits:
    #14-15 (1100 0000 0000 0000) : indicate the frame's resolution.

        !!************ NOTE:*************!!
        The rotation and scaling flag seems to not be used the same way in the sprites.
        And even if rot and scaling is on, the "islast" bit and the flips seems to still work!
        !!************ NOTE:*************!!

WITH "Rotation/Scaling" FLAG ON:
    bits:

        (0-31) Sets the rotation/scaling parameter to use apparently. (Not sure how the last frame is indicated in those!!)
    #0-8 (0000 0001 1111 1111) : X Offset

**objattr2 flags**: 
    bits:
    #12-15 (1111 0000 0000 0000): Palette Number
        0 to 15
    #10-11 (0000 1100 0000 0000): Priority relative to BG
        0 to 3. 0 is highest.
    #0-9 (0000 0011 1111 1111): "Character Name"? Tile number
        0 to 1023 "Upper-left tile index."


    
    
Values of bits 14-15 for the XOffset and YOffset can be combined to get non-square resolution:
YOffset:    XOffset:     Resolution:
00          00            8 x 8
00          01           16 x 16
00          10           32 x 32
00          11           64 x 64

01          00           16 x 8
10          00            8 x 16

01          01           32 x 8
10          01           8  x 32

01          10           32 x 16

10          11           32 x 64

    
--------------------
*AnimationSequences
--------------------
Contains null-entry terminated sequences of 12 bytes animation frames one after the other.
Each sequences is pointed to by entries in the AnimSequenceTable.
As mentioned above, each sequence ends with 12 bytes of zeroes.

The animation frame itself is a reference, in the form of an index, to a meta-frame in the MetaFrames block, 
along with a display duration and an offset, from the logical center of the sprite in the game world, 
for the shadow and the actual image itself.

This datablock may not be aligned on 4 bytes, just like the MetaFrames block, but, if the last sequence doesn't end 
on an offset divisible by 4, some 0xAA padding is appended between the end of the last sequence, and the 
beginning of the next datablock!

----------------------
*ParticleOffsetsTable
----------------------
Offsets from the center of the sprite for a plethora of particle effects attached to the sprite.
The number of entries vary between pokemon, and its unknown what each does.

-------------------
*AnimSequenceTable
-------------------
This table contains several arrays of pointers to animation sequences in the AnimationSequences.
They each regroup sequences that match a same group in the AnimGroupTable. The length of those 
array is defined by the entry in AnimGroupTable that points to it!

----------------
*AnimGroupTable
----------------
Every entry in this table regroups several animation sequences under a group or category.
For example, with character sprites, the first group is the "run" animation group ! 
It contains 8 animations sequences, one for every directions possible.
 
-----------------
*ImageDataTable
-----------------
A table with pointers to every compressed image stored in the sprite!

-----------------------
*CompressedImages
-----------------------
Each compressed image is a made of 2 things. A bunch of pixel strips, and a decompression table.
The pixel strips are basically what remains after as much zero bytes as possible 
were removed from the original image.

The table is basically filled with entries to be read from the smallest offset to the biggest.
Each entries indicate what to push_back into the resulting decompressed image. 
For example, if "PixSrc" is 0, it means push back zeroes, if its an offset, it means push back bytes 
starting there! The amount of bytes to push_back is stored in "Len", so, if its 0x60, then either
push 0x60 0, or 0x60 bytes read at the offset specified!
The last value has an unknown meaning.

Consider this table for Eevee's first frame(converted to big endian):
                                0x31D8, 0x0000, 0x0060, 0x0000, 
0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0020, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 
0x3238, 0x0000, 0x0060, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 
0x0020, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x3298, 0x0000, 0x0060, 0x0000, 
0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x00A0, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 
0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000

If we interpret each 12 bytes entries from the data, here's what we get:
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
¦ Pixel Source ¦ Length    ¦ Unk Val ¦ Meaning                                                     ¦
+--------------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------¦
¦ 0x31D8       ¦ 0x60(96)  ¦ 0x0     ¦ Take 96 bytes from offset 0x31D8                            ¦

+--------------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------¦
¦ 0x0          ¦ 0xA0(160) ¦ 0x0     ¦ Add 160 bytes of null colored pixels.                       ¦
+--------------+-----------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------¦
¦ 0x0          ¦ 0x0       ¦ 0x0     ¦ Null entry. End of Image!                                   ¦
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

About the resolution:
---------------------
Its hard to tell the resolution at this time. 
In general, most images have a squared resolution, but many others do not.. And we can't just guess 
reliably from the total amount of pixels, because some images can be either wider than higher, 
or higher than wider.

However, for images that have a meta-frame, its possible to read their meta-frame data, and determine their resolution!

----------------------------------------
*PaletteBlock
----------------------------------------
This block contains a list of colors used by the sprite. It contains a variable amount of bytes, and 
each colors is usually 4 bytes, in the format RGBX - 8888, stored as big endian. 

Color 0 is transparent!

The length of the palette may vary.

----------------
*About Padding:
----------------
At the end of the WAN header:

Example:

-- With Padding --
#       00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F
---------------------------------------------------------------
OFF_A   D4 41 00 00  EC 41 00 00  01 00 00 00  AA AA AA AA <- Here are the padding bytes
OFF_B   04 04 9D 08  18 18 82 44  18 18 82 44  18 18 82 44 
        ^
        And here's where the next section begins. The padding ensures its aligned on an offset 
        divisible by 16.

    
-- Where no padding is used because its already aligned (ASSUMING OFF_A = 0x8004) --
#       00 01 02 03  04 05 06 07  08 09 0A 0B  0C 0D 0E 0F
------------------------------------------------------------
0x8000  00 00 00 00  D4 41 00 00  EC 41 00 00  01 00 00 00  <- Notice how not even one Byte of 
OFF_B   04 04 9D 08  18 18 82 44  18 18 82 44  18 18 82 44     0xAA padding was used !
        ^
        Its because the next line starts exactly on an offset divisible by 16, thus no need for 
        padding.

NOTES:
-----------------------
- Giratina's sprite (#433) in "/MONSTER/monster.bin" has a lot of extra zeros at the end of its sprite data for some reasons.
