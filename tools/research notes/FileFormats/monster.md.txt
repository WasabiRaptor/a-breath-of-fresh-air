Thanks to: 
- TruePikachu for some of the details on the monster.md format! http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?40199-Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-2-Psy_commando-s-Tools-and-research-notes&p=192560&viewfull=1#post192560
- The WMS project  http://apointlessplace.net/wms
- OgreGunner and nhahtdh for that huge thread on gamefaqs filled with tidbits or information! http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/955859-pokemon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-sky/51698562
- Kelvin Chung for the .grammar file containing much needed information ! http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon
- Gracidea for figuring out the use of the value in the entity entry at offset 0x1A!
- And to everyone I might have forgotten about ^^;

This file contains the base data for every pokemon in the game.

NOTES:
- The first entry is a dummy entry, and its repeated in the secondary gender section.
- The file contains 1,155 entries.

The file is split into 3 Sections:
Index#              NbOfEntries             Description
-----------         ------------            -----------
[0   -  537[        555                     Primary genders data for all regular Pokemon. (Somehow includes primal dialga)
[537 -  600[        45                      Special unique Pokemon/entities entries.
[600 - 1154]        555                     Secondary genders data for all regular Pokemon. (Somehow includes primal dialga)

From entry #600 onward, the entries for each Pokemon/entities between index [0 - 537[ are repeated. 
However, the repeated entries have their gender changed. For genderless and female or male only species, their gender is set to invalid(0) in the repeated data!
