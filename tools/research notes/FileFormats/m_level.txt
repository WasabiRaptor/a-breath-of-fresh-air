/BALANCE/m_level.bin
---------------------
m_level.bin is a pack file, with each of its sub-files compressed into PKDPX files, and then wrapped into SIR0 containers.
The first sub-file index seems deliberately forced to 0x1200, given there is an extra unneeded row of 0xFF padding before the 
first one.

Its purpose is to indicate the total amount of experience required to reach a level, and indicate the stat increase for each 
levels up until level 100, for every pokemon in the game!

The structure of its sub-files, once decompressed, and after having been removed from its SIR0 container, 
is exactly the same for each of them. 

The first three entries are for Bulbasaur, Ivysaur and Venusaur. The 3 are identical though. 
But if someone wanted it'd be possible to change each's stats growth individually!

The format of a single entry goes as follow:

Offset      Length      Type        Description
------      ------      ----        -----------
0x0         4           int32       The total amount of experience required to reach that level. The value is absolute, not relative to the last level!
0x4         2           uint16      HP growth for this level.
0x6         1           uint8       Attack growth for this level.
0x7         1           uint8       Special attack growth for this level.
0x8         1           uint8       Defense growth for this level.
0x9         1           uint8       Special defense growth for this level.
0xA         2           uint16      Null.
------      ------      ----        -----------
Total:      12 bytes


NOTES:
------
- EoS     : 571 sub-files. 1 for each pokemons. And possibly a few that are used for special purpose, given there are less pokemon than that in gen 4?
- EoT/EoD : 1,192 sub-files.
- EoT/D has a few files that are compressed as AT4PX instead of PKDPX. Possibly a dev oversight as it was fixed in EoS !
- Exactly 100, 12 bytes entries, one after the other.
- The entry for level 1 is entirely null, given there is no level 0, and no exp requirements or stat growth needed. Base
  stats must be stored somewhere else!
