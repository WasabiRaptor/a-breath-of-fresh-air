Pass a file containing only the encoded SIR0 ptr offset list. In a SIR0-wrappend file, that list begins where the second pointer in 
the SIR0 header points to.
Drag and drop that file with only the encoded offset list onto the .bat file, and the resulting decoded 
offsets will be written to decoded.txt!
It ignores padding bytes at the end of the list.
